Read this whole document before starting this project. There is a lot of
valuable information here, including the Final Comments section at the bottom.
</em>

<p>
Congratulations, you are opening  your own flight booking service!

<p>
You have access to a flights database. You will provide a service
that lets users search through the database and book flights.

<p>
In this homework, you have two main tasks.  The first is to design a 
database of your customers and the flights they book. The second task
is to complete a working prototype of your flight booking application
that connects to the database then allows customers to use a  command-line
interface to search, book, and cancel flights.
We have already provided code for a complete UI and partial back end; 
you will implement the rest of the back end.
In real-life, you would develop a Web-based interface instead of a command-line interface, but we use a command-line interface to simplify this homework.

<h3>Task 0: Running the starter code (0 points)</h3>

<p>
  Your system will be a Java application. Download the <a href="hw7.tar.gz" target="_blank">starter code files</a>; you will see the following files:
<ul>
<li><code>FlightService.java</code>: the command-line interface to your flight-booking service.
  Calls into <code>Query.java</code> to run customer transactions.
<li><code>Query.java</code>: code to run customer transactions against
  your database, such as booking flights and reviewing reservations.
<li><code>dbconn.properties</code>: a file containing settings to connect
  to your database. You need to edit it before running the starter code.
<li><code>sqljdbc4.jar</code>: the JDBC to SQL Server driver.  
This tells Java how to connect to a SQL Azure database server, and needs to be 
in your <code>CLASSPATH</code> (see below)
<li><code>sqljdbc.jar</code>: the JDBC to SQL Server driver for older versions of Java. Use this driver only if the other one does not work for you. 
</ul>

<p>
To run the starter code, you can simply run javac and java from the command line.

<p>Please follow the instructions for your platform as shown in the table below. The last command launches the starter code. Normally, you run it like this:</p>
<p><code>java FlightService</code> </p>

  <table border="1">
<thead style="font-weight: bold">
  <tr><th>Windows</th>
      <th>Linux or Mac</th>
  </tr>
</thead>

<tbody><tr>
<td><pre>
cd \where\you\unzipped\the\starter\code
<em>[replace the directory below with your JDK's bin\ directory]</em>
path C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_67\bin;%path%
set CLASSPATH=.;sqljdbc4.jar
javac -g FlightService.java Query.java
java FlightService
</pre></td>

<td><pre>
cd /where/you/unzipped/the/starter/code


export CLASSPATH=.:sqljdbc4.jar
javac -g FlightService.java Query.java
java FlightService
</pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>If you got an error message about the JDBC driver when running the above, try to use the older driver <em>sqljdbc.jar</em> instead of sqljdbc4.jar.



<p>Or you can use Eclipse
      <ol>
        <li>Create a workspace with a project. We'll refer to this project as hw7 from now on. </li>
        <li>Copy the .java files into the project src/ folder. </li>
        <li>Copy the .jar and .properties files into the hw7 folder. Make sure you add the necessary values to the .properties file now. </li>
        <li>Right click on the project, choose Build Path -&gt; Configure Build Path..., then Add Jars..., then expand hw7 and select the sqljdbc[4].jar file. Click Ok and then Ok again to close the menus. </li>
        <li>Click the Run button. 
      </ol>

    <p>You also need to access your <code>Flights</code> database on SQL Azure from Homework 3. Modify <code>dbconn.properties</code> with your servername, username, and password for SQL Azure. This allows your java program to connect to the database on SQL Azure. In practice, in is not safe to store passwords openly in text files, but it is ok for this assignment. Also, you can use the small version of the flights dataset. We are assuming that all queries search and book flights for July 2015, which is in the small dataset. It's ok if your database contains more flight data.
      


<p>Now you should see the command-line prompt for your Filght service:
<pre>
 *** Please enter one of the following commands ***
> login &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
> search &lt;origin_city&gt; &lt;destination_city&gt; &lt;direct&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;nb itineraries&gt;
> book &lt;itinerary_id&gt;
> reservations
> cancel &lt;reservation_id&gt;
> quit
></pre>


<p>The <code>search</code> command works (sort of).  Try typing:
<pre>
search "Seattle WA" "Boston MA" 1 14 10
</pre>

<p> The user is requesting to list the top 10 direct flights from Seattle to Boston on July 14th 2015 ordered by flight time, which is the sum of the actual_time values for all flights in the itinerary.
      
<p>You should see a list of flights between the origin and destination city for your desired data. The starter code only lists direct flights.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
      
<p>The requirements for the flight service system are the following:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>login</strong> command takes a <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt> as input. It checks that the user exists in the database and that the password matches. You can simply populate your user database outside of this application.
        
        <li><strong>search</strong> command takes as input an
        <tt>origin city</tt>, a <tt>destination city</tt>, a
        <tt>boolean</tt> value to indicate if the user wants to search
        only for direct flights or if one hop is ok, the
        <tt>date</tt>, and the <tt>nb itineraries</tt>. For one hop
        flights, different carriers can be used for the flights. We
        only have flights for July 2015 and July 2005 in
        flights-small.csv. So the date should simply be an integer
        indicating which day in July 2015 the user wants to book. Note
        that the starter code ignores the month and year
        entirely. Change the query to fix the month and year to July
        2015 or you can add month and year as extra, optional,
        arguments. But note that we will test your Query.java using
        the starter FlightService.java. The command should first list
        all the direct flights sorted on actual_time, then list the
        flights with one stop also sorted by total actual_time. Ignore
        flights that have a null actual_time. The number of
        itineraries argument enables the user to limit the result to
        only top-k itineraries. Each itinerary should have a unique
        <tt>itinerary id</tt>. The <tt>itinerary id</tt> can simply
        be the <tt>row id</tt>, which is the index of
        the itinerary in the sorted search result. If no itineraries match the
        search query, the system should return an informative error message.
        The user need not be logged in to search for flights. It is up to you how you want to display
        the search results.  We will only test that the result includes
        the number of flights (1 or 2) and the total flight time. But we expect your code to display more information.

        <li><strong>book</strong> command enables a user to book an
        itinerary. We only book one-way itineraries. To book a
        round-trip, the user needs to book two separate
        itineraries. The user must be logged in to book an
        itinerary. The user must enter a valid itinerary id. The user
        may only book an itinerary displayed in the most recent search
        query. To implement this feature, you should remember the
        itineraries returned by the latest search in your Java code.

        <li><strong>reservations</strong> command lists all
       reservations for the user. Each reservation must have a unique
       identifier (which is different from the itinerary ID).  The
       user must be logged in to view reservations.

      <li><strong>cancel</strong> command enables a user to cancel an
      existing reservation. The user must be logged in to cancel
      reservations and must provide a valid reservation ID.
        
      </ul>
      
<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Task 1: Customer database design (5 points)</h3> 

<p>
Your first task is to design and add tables to your flights database. You need to create at least a <code>Customer</code> table.  For each customer, the table should store a unique identifier, a full name, a zipcode, and a password. You should also create one or more tables to hold the reservations made by customers. The design of these tables are up to you. You can add other tables to your database as well.

<p><strong>What to turn in: </strong>
a single text file called <em>setup.sql</em> with CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements for your customer database that populate each table with a few tuples (minimum 8 tuples): you will turn in this file. This file should be runnable on SQL Azure through SQL Server Management Studio. Write a separate script file with DROP TABLE statements; it's useful to run it whenever you find a bug in your schema or data (don't turn in this file). 


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Task 2: Java customer application (20 points)</h3>

<p>
Your second task is to write the Java application that your customers will
use, by completing the starter code.
You need to modify only <code>Query.java</code>.  Except for the small change needed in Task 2A, do not modify <code>FlightService.java</code> because we will test your homework using the current version of <code>FlightService.java</code>.
Actually, you can modify <code>FlightService.java</code> if you want to improve your application, but make sure we can still test your <code>Query.java</code> on the original <code>FlightService.java</code></p>
      
<p> <b> What to turn in: </b> the Java file <code>Query.java</code>.

      

<p>
When your application starts, it shows the above menu of options to the
user. Your task is to implement the functionality behind these options.

<p>
<strong>Be sure to use SQL transactions when appropriate. The same user
      can log in multiple times from different terminals. Different users can also use the
      same application at the same time from different terminals.</strong>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Task 2A: Stop SQL Injection (5 points)</h4>

<p>Consider the <code>search</code> function.

<p>Now type this at the prompt:
      
<pre>search "Seattle WA" "Boston MA'  and actual_time > 300 and dest_city='Boston MA" 1 14 10
</pre>
      
<p>What happens? You get only flights longer than 300 min.  Now type this:

<pre>search "Seattle WA" "Boston MA'; create table Foo(a int); SELECT year, month_id,day_of_month,carrier_id,flight_num,origin_city,actual_time from Flights where origin_city = 'Seattle WA" 1 14 10
</pre>

<p>Check that this statement actually did successfully create a new table. Imagine if
it did other things instead like drop tables or look up the list of customers and their passwords. This is SQL injection: hackers like to do it on Website interfaces 
to databases.  We provide a correct, fixed function. Update FlightService.java to use
the correct function. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> Task 2B: Transaction management (15 points) </h3>

<p>
  You must use SQL transactions
in order to guarantee ACID properties: you must define begin- and end-transaction statements, 
and insert them in appropriate places in <code>Query.java</code>. In particular, you must 
ensure that the following constraints are always satisfied, even if multiple instances of your 
application talk to the database at the same time.

<p><b>C1</b>. Each flight should have a maximum capacity that must not be exceeded. For this assignment, you can
make it very small like 3. So only 3 people will be able to book any given flight.

<p><b>C2</b>. A customer may have at most one reservation for any given day. If you choose to use multiple reservations for an itinerary, then ensure that a customer may have at most one itinerary for any given day.

<p>You must use transactions correctly such that race conditions
introduced by concurrent execution cannot lead to an inconsistent
state of the database. For example, multiple customers may try to book
the same flight at the same time. Your properly designed transactions
should prevent that.</p>

<p> Design transactions correctly. Avoid including user interaction inside a 
SQL transaction: that is,
don't begin a transaction then wait for the user to decide what she
wants to do (why?). The rule of thumb is that transactions need to be as short as possible, but not shorter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When one uses a DBMS, by default <strong>each statement executes in its own transaction</strong>. To group multiple statements into a transaction, we use 
<pre>BEGIN TRANSACTION</pre>
<p>....
<pre>COMMIT or ROLLBACK </pre>
<p>This is the same when executing transactions from Java, by default each SQL statement will be executed as its own transaction. To group multiple statements into one transaction in java, you can do one of three things:

<p><strong>Approach 1:</strong>
<p>We provide you with three helper methods. So before your first statement in the transaction, simply execute
<pre>beginTransaction();</pre>
<p>When you are done with the     transaction, then call:
<pre>commitTransaction(); </pre>
<p>OR
<pre>rollbackTransaction(); </pre>
<p><strong>Approach 2: </strong>
<p>You can execute the SQL code for START TRANSACTION and friends
  directly, using the SQL we have provided in the starter code (also
  check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee336270.aspx" >SQL Azure's transactions documentation)</a>:
<pre>
// When you start the database up
Connection conn = [...]
conn.setAutoCommit(true); // This is the default setting, actually
conn.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE);

// In each operation that is to be a multi-statement SQL transaction:
conn.setAutoCommit(false); // You MUST do this in order to tell JDBC that you are starting a multi-statement transaction

beginTransactionStatement.executeUpdate();

[... execute updates and queries.]

commitTransactionStatement.executeUpdate();
[OR]
rollbackTransactionStatement.executeUpdate();

conn.setAutoCommit(true);  // To make sure that future statements execute as their own transactions.
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Approach 3:</strong>

<pre>
// When you start the database up
Connection conn = [...]
conn.setAutoCommit(true); // This is the default setting, actually
conn.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE);


// In each operation that is to be a multi-statement SQL transaction:

conn.setAutoCommit(false);
[... execute updates and queries.]
conn.commit();
[OR]
conn.rollback();
conn.setAutoCommit(true);
 

</pre>

<p>When auto comit is set to true, each statement executes in its own
transaction. With auto-commit set to false, you can execute many
statements within a single transaction. By default, on any new
connection to a DB auto-commit is set to true.

<p>To test that your transactions work correctly, we recommend the
  following (and this is how we will test your homework).  Place a
  breakpoint in the middle of your transaction.  Run two (or more?)
  instances of FlightService.java, say A and B.  Let both reach the
  same point in the code then you decide which one you allow to
  proceed, and thus control the order in which the transactions are
  interleaved.  <p>


<p>
<b>FINAL COMMENTS</b>:
<ul>
<li><p>The starter code is designed to give you a gentle introduction
   to embedding SQL into Java.  Start by running the starter code,
   examine it and make sure you understand the part that works.
   You will need to create new tables and slowly add code to the
   application.

</p>
<li><p> The completed project has multiple simple SQL queries
   embedded in the Java code.  Some queries are <em>parameterized</em>:
   a parameter is a constant that is known only at runtime, and
   therefore appears as a '?' in the SQL code in Java: you already
   have examples in the started code.
   </p>
<li> We won't use recovery in this homework.  Instead you will rely on
   the script file that you need to prepare for Task 1.  This file
   contains all the CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements that are needed
   to start your project.
</ul>
