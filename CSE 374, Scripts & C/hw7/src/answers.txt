1. Both get_move and symbol are set to 0, thus making them essentially NULL since
they don't have pointers to anything. Score is actually defined in the Character
class, on the otherhand.

2. Each character in the game is asked for their move on each turn. Monster, 
BabyMonster, and Player are all extensions of the Character class, so when the 
specified character has get_move_logged() called, the next call is to the 
subclass specific get_move() method. All moves are stored in a log as well.

3. Since the const keyword makes it so you can't edit instances, having a const 
get_move() would forbid us from changing data in an instance. This would make 
behavior like BabyMonster's impossible, since we wouldn't be able to change 
_move.

4. The log object is created in each character and all derived sublcasses to keep
track of previous moves. Thus, the log needs to be destructed explicitly in
~Character.

5. BabyMonster inherited ~Character, which destructs the only object created when
a BabyMonster is created (the log). Thus, no other destructor besides this and 
the implicit destructor is needed.
