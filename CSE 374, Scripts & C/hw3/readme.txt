I handled the extra URLs by simply removing them manually. After considering the
problem for quite sometime, it was really the only solution I could come up with. I
would have liked to use the HTML table formatting to identify only the URLs that
were in the top 100, but it was a very reasonable solution, considering the
abundance of HTML tags. Besides the formatting, there was no clear patterns that
would locate them. So, I manually found these excess links on the HTML page, and
removed them. They included URLs for the list the website was on, URLs for babel,
which was a translation engine, and a single en.wikipedia URL (not to be mistakened
for the wikipedia URL that is actually on the top 100). If there was a better way
to do this, it would be awesome if you could tell the class!
